I just noticed that [Jimbo Mathus recorded “Long Black Veil.”](https://jimbomathus.bandcamp.com/track/long-black-veil) It’s not a surprise. “Long Black Veil” is a pretty popular song among the folk/roots music crowd. [Tim O’Brien](https://timobrien.net/) recorded it on Fiddler’s Green, and [We Banjo 3](https://www.webanjo3.com/) did it as well. It’s got a great chorus that’s easy to learn and fun to sing along to. It’s not a surprise that it’s popular.

But the thing is: I kinda hate this song.

I think I was in the car listening to We Banjo 3’s version when I finally understood what the song was about. And ever since I’ve been unable to enjoy it. Here’s the story…

One night, there’s a murder in this town. Witnesses describe the murderer as looking like the song’s narrator. The narrator, however, is innocent, and he has an alibi: he was sleeping with his best friend’s wife. But he doesn’t tell anyone because he wants to protect her honor (or something, I guess). She also doesn’t tell anyone, because… reasons. As a result, the narrator is hanged for this murder he didn’t commit. Which, of course, means the actual murderer gets away with it. The chorus is about the narrator watching from the afterlife as his best friend’s wife walks around at night wearing the titular veil and mourning his death.

It seems like we’re meant to feel bad for these people; that we’re meant to think that this guy was noble for being willing to die to protect the honor of this woman. But c’mon, sleeping with your best friend’s wife makes you the asshole. And am I supposed to feel sad for this woman who a) was cheating on her husband, and b) allowed someone she cared for to be executed for a crime he didn’t commit? And it seems like we’re meant to just ignore the fact that the selfishness of these two people _allowed a murderer to go free_.

Now it’s often the case that songs like this—songs that make the rounds in the folk/roots music scene—were written a _long_ time ago. As such, one might be a little less judgemental if the values expressed by the song seem antiquated by modern standards. But ”Long Black Veil” was written in 1959, and I just have a hard time with the idea that, even in 1959, covering up your affair with your best friend’s wife and allowing a murderer to go free could be considered laudible.

And, if I’m honest, it bothers me a little that people are continuing to record this nonsense.
