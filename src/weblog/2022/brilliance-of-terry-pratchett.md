I think it’s hard to overstate the brilliance of [Sir Terry
Pratchett](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/), although it may have been easy
to miss because you were so busy laughing.

I suspect—because I’ve seen it make the rounds on Twitter—many people are
familiar with the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic
unfairness.

  <blockquote>
    The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they
    managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight
    dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost
    fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a
    season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost
    about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and
    wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in
    Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was
    that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty
    dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten
    years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have
    spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet
    feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes "Boots" theory of socioeconomic
    unfairness.

That’s a pretty cogent explanation of why being poor is so expensive.

Recently, I came across some of my old Kindle highlights from [Feet of
Clay](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/books/feet-of-clay/). I thought I’d
share them here.

    …while it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in
    a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited
    to the very best social occasions.

    It wasn’t by eliminating the impossible that you got at the truth, however
    improbable; it was by the much harder process of eliminating the
    possibilities.

  <blockquote>
    People look down on stuff like geography and meteorology, and not only
    because they’re standing on one and being soaked by the other. They don’t
    look quite like real science. But geography is only physics slowed down and
    with a few trees stuck on it, and meteorology is full of excitingly
    fashionable chaos and complexity.

I love that take on the famous Sherlock Holmes quote about eliminating the
impossible and the appreciation of meteorology.

I think maybe I’ll go reread some of my favorite Discworld novels…
