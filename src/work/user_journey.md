This is a tool for data scientists, product owners, and designers to explore how users on Spotify navigate the various clients to find something to stream. It provides both a high level summary of how many streams can be attributed to any page, and a detailed view of steps taken by users to reach a stream. The application helps users understand how our clients are used so that they can make better product decisions.
