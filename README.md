I’ve moved this repository over to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/darth_mall/darthmall.net

Evan Sheehan’s [personal website](https://darthmall.net/).

## Set up

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

The development server will listen on http://localhost:8080/.

## Configuration

Environment variables can be placed in a <samp>.env</samp> file in the project root (this file is ignored by Git).

Important environment variables:

- `WEBMENTION_IO_TOKEN`
- `ELEVENTY_ENV`
