My final piece for Golan Levin's Interactive Art & Computational Design wherein
the viewer is transformed into a tree while standing in front of the piece with
arms raised. The body forms the trunk, and the arms form large boughs, as
branches sprout from the viewer and eventually grow blossoms at their tips.
Built using openFrameworks, the piece uses OpenNI to detect the viewer's pose
and place branches along the torso and arms.
