Howdy, my name is Evan.

![Me, a 30-something white man, in a red vest, holding a glass of whisky and
smiling at the camera at a ski resort in Norway](/img/about.jpg)

Professionally, I design and build websites, web applications, and data visualizations. I
am currently employed by the [Cooperative Institute for Research in the
Atmospher](https://www.cira.colostate.edu/) (CIRA) and I work at the [National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration](https://noaa.gov) (NOAA) where I am the web developer for
[Science On a Sphere](https://sos.noaa.gov).

Unprofessionally, I like to spend what little free time I have playing traditional Irish
music or board games. I am good at neither.
