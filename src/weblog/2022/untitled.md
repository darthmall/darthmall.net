Jeremy Keith recently wrote about his desire to [democratize the web](https://adactio.com/journal/19356)—to make it easier for people to publish at a URL they control. It’s a desire I certainly share. I’d love to see a larger [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) with more people blogging. I like to imagine that [conversations on the IndieWeb](/weblog/2021/webmentions/#why-are-you-so-excited-about-this%3F) would resemble the days of philosophers publishing essays back and forth, and could help foster more thoughtful, slower conversations online as opposed to the endless outrage that pervades social media.

But I’m not optimistic about this future—the future where anyone can make a website without being hemmed in by some silo. This feels like a common refrain throughout the history of computers. I mean, wasn’t this kind of the goal of [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard): to allow people to write software applications without having to learn to program? And then of course there’s Dreamweaver and Microsoft Frontpage. These days we have Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, and ESRI StoryMaps. Wordpress has been around for ages, and while it may not be for building custom websites without code, it certainly puts more control in the hands of the site owner than something like Medium or Tumblr.

The fact that we have not yet succeeded in democratizing web development in this way does not mean that it’s impossible, but it does give me pause. Maybe automating web development is harder than we think. Maybe we just become so comfortable with these problems that we no longer recognize the complexity inherent in the field and we begin to think we can just automate it away. It does seem to be a curse for all software developers that we think we can solve all problems with the right piece of software.

> The problem is that unless they [no-code tools] work 100%, and always produce good accessible performant code, then they’re going to be another example of the [law of leaky abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/). If a no-code tool can get someone 90% of the way to what they want, that seems pretty good. But if that person than has to spend an inordinate amount of time on the remaining 10% then all the good work of the no-code tool is somewhat wasted.

Maybe the reason that all of these no-code tools seem to only ever get you 90% of the way there is because that last 10% represents the technical knowledge that you can’t escape. I was just listening to an episode of [Kodsnack with Chris Ferdinandi as a guest](https://kodsnack.se/484/) where they discussed why some of the reasons for choosing a JS framework may not be all that realistic; one of which was that using a framework doesn’t necessarily absolve you from understanding how it works—at least a little bit. Until you start to understand how the framework works, you will probably run into cases where you use it in a way that causes you problems with performance or something. I suspect the same may be true of these no-code tools. You can build yourself a website that _looks_ right, but you have to understand how all those blocks you’re dragging around the interface get turned into HTML and CSS so that you can use it create a performant, accessible website. Which implies at least some understanding of how to build for the web.

I agree that this sounds like a nightmare. And I’d add that I don’t want to see the web reduced to a handful of corporate sites that publish all of the “user-generated content” on the web.
