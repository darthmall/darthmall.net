When I was a kid — probably from about 3<sup>rd</sup> grade through 5<sup>th</sup> or maybe 6<sup>th</sup> grade — the only books I read for fun were <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy. My dad had read them to my brother and me at bed time, and I loved them so much that I got a box set of my own with all four books in paperback.

I read them over and over and over again. I do not recall reading any other books that hadn’t been assigned in school at this time in my life. The books are well-loved. It wasn’t until I discovered Terry Brooks’s Shannara series at a book fair — I’m pretty sure this was 5<sup>th</sup> grade, but it may have been 6<sup>th</sup> — that I started exploring other fantasy series.[^1]

I no longer reread books like this, no matter how much I enjoyed the book. My <abbr>TBR</abbr> (to be read) list is always so long that I just move on to the next thing.

[^1]: In fact, up until that point, I’m not sure I realized that fantasy was an entire genre.
