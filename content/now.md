I’m back at work after a three month sabbatical of sorts. Took a few days to get my bearings and I’ve already messed up one logistical thing with my calendar, but I’m beginning to get the hang of it again. It’s certainly much easier to be working now that my kid is in school three days a week; juggling forty-ish hours of childcare plus 20 hours of work was a challenge.

The big question on my mind is: when am I going to find time to finish the wheels for my Trek? I’m so close.
