I’m coming up on the end of a three month sabbatical from work. The first half of which was devoted to enjoying my last few weeks with my son before he started preschool. The second half of which was devoted to checking a few household projects off of my list, and getting a feel for what being a stay-at-home-dad would be like.

## Bikes

Aside from doing some work around the house like cleaning the garage and the utility room, I’ve been working on my bikes. I gave my main bike—an old Specialized Stumpjumper—a thorough cleaning and adjusted the derailleurs so that it rides like a dream now. I have some more changes to the bike planned, as time and funds allow.

I’ve also been building a new set of wheels for my old Trek road bike so that I’ll be able to ride it again (a bike shop I went to ordered me a wheel too wide for the old frame, so I haven’t ridden it in years). Since I have the Stumpjumper for commuting, I built a fixed rear wheel with a Phil Wood track hub for the bike because I enjoy fixed gear bikes.

## Community

Recently, I’ve felt drawn towards community-building activities and felt a strong desire to get more involved in my city and county. The challenge has always been finding time and energy for it. Between parenting, housework, and a job—even a half-time job—it’s difficult to find enough time and energy to exercise and play music (which are important for my physical and mental health), let alone getting involved in unpaid work like bicycle advocacy or volunteering somewhere like [Community Cycles](https://communitycycles.org/).

Part of the purpose of this sabbatical is to explore how I would feel about leaving my job—which, for once, I like—to make more time to take care of my family and become more involved in my community. I’m fortunate in the sense that my wife is the bread-winner in our family, so we might actually be able to afford being a single income household. And I confess that the idea of reversing the typically-gendered roles of bread-winner and stay-at-home-parent is appealing. Still, it’s hard to escape the feeling that not working is lazy; that unpaid work is not real work; that leaving a job to make time for city council and <abbr>PTA</abbr> meetings is extravagant. Intellectually, I know this is a byproduct of a society too fixated on money as a proxy for value, but it is deeply embedded in my psyche and hard to escape.

Nonetheless, despite having a job I find interesting and enjoyable, and one which I think is actually valuable—even if it’s not essential—community work feels more important to me at this moment. My job is interesting, but I have very little impact at work on the issues that are truly important to me—issues like transportation safety, housing, education, and the climate crisis.

So as I’m preparing to head back to work in October, these are the things that are on my mind. Can I find the time to be a parent, keep house, work, and be more involved in our community? Part of me wants to believe that it is possible if only I can be _organized enough_, but I have a sinking feeling that that is not true. There are only so many hours in the day.
