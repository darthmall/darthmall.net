Howdy, my name is Evan.

{% picture "src/img/about.jpg", "", "Me, a 30-something white man, in a red vest, holding a glass of whisky and smiling at the camera at a ski resort in Norway" %}

Professionally, I design and build websites, web applications, and data visualizations. I
am currently employed by the [Cooperative Institute for Research in the
Atmospher](https://www.cira.colostate.edu/) (CIRA) and I work at the [National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration](https://noaa.gov) (NOAA) where I am the web developer for
[Science On a Sphere](https://sos.noaa.gov).

Unprofessionally, I like to spend what little free time I have playing traditional Irish
music or board games. I am good at neither.

The animated illustration of me in the header was drawn by the talented [Joe
Medwid](http://joemedwid.com/). This site uses [Sporting
Grotesque](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/sporting-grotesque/) for page titles,
[Epilogue](https://www.etceteratype.co/epilogue) for headings and body copy, and
[League Mono](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-mono) for small
fonts and code snippets. The site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).
The social icons in the footer are [Super Tiny
